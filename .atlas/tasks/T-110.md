# Frontend: Create UI for Listing and Viewing Specs

This task involves building the frontend components to display the list of available feature specifications and view their content. This work depends on the `GET /api/specs` and `GET /api/specs/{filename}` endpoints being available from the backend.

## Sub-tasks:

-   [ ] **Create a Sidebar Component for Specs:**
    -   Add a new section to the main sidebar titled "Feature Specs".
    -   This component should call the `GET /api/specs` endpoint to fetch the list of spec filenames.
    -   Render the fetched filenames as a clickable list within the sidebar.

-   [ ] **Create a Spec Viewer Component:**
    -   This component will be the main view for displaying the content of a selected spec.
    -   It should be able to render markdown content nicely. You can use a library like `react-markdown` for this.

-   [ ] **Implement Navigation Logic:**
    -   When a user clicks on a spec filename in the sidebar, the application should:
        1.  Make a `GET /api/specs/{filename}` request to fetch the spec's content.
        2.  Pass the fetched markdown content to the Spec Viewer component.
        3.  Display the Spec Viewer component in the main content area of the UI.
    -   Consider how to manage the currently selected spec in the application's state.
