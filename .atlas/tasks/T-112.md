# Frontend: Implement Editing and Saving Specs

This task focuses on turning the "Spec Viewer" into a full-fledged editor, allowing users to modify and save the content of the specification files.

## Sub-tasks:

-   [ ] **Integrate a Markdown Editor:**
    -   Replace the static markdown viewer from Task `T-104` with a rich text/markdown editor component. A simple `textarea` is a good starting point, but a more advanced editor (like `react-simplemde-editor` or a custom one) would be better.
    -   The editor should be populated with the spec content when a spec is opened.

-   [ ] **Manage Editor State:**
    -   Use React state to manage the content of the editor as the user types.

-   [ ] **Implement "Save" Functionality:**
    -   Add a "Save" button to the editor view.
    -   When clicked, the button should trigger a `POST /api/specs/{filename}` request.
    -   The body of the request must contain the current content from the editor state.
    -   Provide user feedback on save (e.g., a "Saved!" message, or disabling the button until further changes are made).
