# Backend: Implement API for Main Application Spec

This task is to create the backend API endpoints required to read and write the main `application.md` file.

## Sub-tasks:

-   [x] **Create `GET /api/application` endpoint:**
    -   This endpoint must read the content of the file at `.atlas/application.md`.
    -   If the file exists, return its content in a JSON response (e.g., `{ "content": "..." }`).
    -   If the file does not exist, the endpoint must return a `404 Not Found` HTTP status code.

-   [x] **Create `POST /api/application` endpoint:**
    -   This endpoint is responsible for writing content to the `.atlas/application.md` file.
    -   It should expect a JSON body containing the new content (e.g., `{ "content": "..." }`).
    -   The endpoint will write the received content to the file, overwriting it if it already exists or creating it if it does not.
    -   Return a success status (e.g., `200 OK` or `201 Created`) upon successful completion.

-   [x] **Add Robust Error Handling:**
    -   Ensure that any potential file system errors (e.g., permissions issues) during read/write operations are caught and result in an appropriate `500 Internal Server Error` response.
