# Frontend: Implement Deletion of Specs

This task covers the functionality for deleting a feature specification file from the UI.

## Sub-tasks:

-   [ ] **Add a "Delete" Button:**
    -   In the spec editor/viewer, add a "Delete" button. It should be clearly distinct from the "Save" button.

-   [ ] **Implement a Confirmation Dialog:**
    -   To prevent accidental deletion, clicking the "Delete" button should not immediately delete the file.
    -   Instead, it should open a confirmation dialog (e.g., using `window.confirm()` or a custom modal component) that asks the user "Are you sure you want to delete this spec?".

-   [ ] **Implement Deletion Logic:**
    -   If the user confirms the deletion, make a `DELETE /api/specs/{filename}` API call.
    -   After a successful deletion:
        -   The UI should navigate away from the now-deleted spec's view (e.g., back to a neutral landing page).
        -   The list of specs in the sidebar should be refreshed to reflect the deletion.
