# Backend: Implement API for Feature Specifications

This task is to create the backend API endpoints necessary to manage feature specification files. These files are markdown documents stored in the `.atlas/specs/` directory.

Refer to the parent spec `002-feature_specifications.md` for the overall design.

## Sub-tasks:

-   [ ] **Create `GET /api/specs` endpoint:**
    -   This endpoint should read the `.atlas/specs/` directory.
    -   It should return a JSON array containing the filenames of all `.md` files found in that directory.
    -   Ensure it handles the case where the directory is empty or does not exist gracefully.

-   [ ] **Create `GET /api/specs/{filename}` endpoint:**
    -   This endpoint should read the content of a specific file, e.g., `.atlas/specs/001-example.md`.
    -   The `{filename}` will be passed as a URL parameter.
    -   It should return the raw markdown content of the file.
    -   Implement error handling for cases where the file does not exist (e.g., return a 404 Not Found status).

-   [ ] **Create `POST /api/specs/{filename}` endpoint:**
    -   This endpoint is responsible for both creating new spec files and updating existing ones.
    -   It should receive the markdown content in the request body.
    -   It should write this content to the specified file path: `.atlas/specs/{filename}`.
    -   If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.

-   [ ] **Create `DELETE /api/specs/{filename}` endpoint:**
    -   This endpoint should delete the specified file from the `.atlas/specs/` directory.
    -   Implement a success response on successful deletion and an error response (e.g., 404) if the file doesn't exist.
