# Initial Project Scaffolding

This task involves setting up the foundational project structure for the Atlas CLI tool, which includes a local web-based UI. The project will be built using Bun, React, and TypeScript.

## Sub-tasks:

- [x] **Initialize Bun Project**:
    - Create a new Bun project with TypeScript support.
    - Set up `tsconfig.json` for optimal development.
- [x] **Web UI Setup (React)**:
    - Integrate React into the project for the web-based user interface. This might involve setting up a separate `frontend` directory or a monorepo structure.
    - Install necessary React and ReactDOM types.
    - Configure a basic React component to ensure it renders correctly.
- [x] **Directory Structure**:
    - Establish a clear directory structure, e.g., `src/cli` for command-line logic and `src/web` (or `frontend`) for the UI.
    - Ensure `.atlas` directory is in the root as specified in the project context.
- [x] **Build Configuration**:
    - Set up `bun build` commands for both the CLI and the web UI, if applicable.
    - Ensure the build process can handle TypeScript and React (JSX/TSX).
- [x] **Basic Scripting**:
    - Add basic `package.json` scripts for `start`, `build`, `test` (if applicable), and `lint`.
- [x] **Basic README**:
    - Add the basic commands in the README.md
