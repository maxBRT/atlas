# Initial Project Scaffolding

This task involves setting up the foundational project structure for the Atlas application. The project will be a single Bun application that serves both a web UI and a backend API.

## Sub-tasks:

- [x] **Initialize Bun Project**:
    - Create a new Bun project (`bun init`).
    - Configure `tsconfig.json` and install necessary dependencies like React, ReactDOM, and their types.
- [x] **Establish Directory Structure**:
    - Create a `src` directory.
    - Inside `src`, set up subdirectories for the different parts of the application:
        - `src/server`: For the Bun backend server and API logic.
        - `src/frontend`: For the React + TypeScript frontend code.
        - `src/cli`: For the `atlas init` command logic.
- [x] **Configure Build Process**:
    - Set up `bun build` commands in `package.json`.
    - The build process must bundle the React frontend into static assets.
    - The build process must also prepare the server and CLI code.
- [x] **Basic "Hello World" Setup**:
    - Create a minimal Bun server in `src/server` that serves a basic `index.html`.
    - Create a simple React component in `src/frontend` and configure the build to inject it into the `index.html`.
    - Ensure the development server (`bun --watch run src/server/index.ts`) works as expected.
- [x] **Add Project Scripts**:
    - Add scripts to `package.json` for `start:dev`, `build`, and `lint`.
- [x] **Update README**:
    - Add initial instructions to the `README.md` on how to set up and run the project.
