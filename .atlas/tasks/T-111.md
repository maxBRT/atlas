# Frontend: Implement Creation of New Specs

This task covers the UI and logic for creating a new feature specification file. This will involve adding a "New" button, creating a form/modal for user input, and interacting with the `POST /api/specs/{filename}` endpoint.

## Sub-tasks:

-   [ ] **Add "New Feature Spec" Button:**
    -   Place a button, clearly labeled "New Spec" or similar, near the list of specs in the sidebar.

-   [ ] **Create a "New Spec" Dialog/Form:**
    -   When the "New Feature Spec" button is clicked, open a dialog or modal that prompts the user for the new spec's filename.
    -   The input field should have a placeholder or helper text suggesting the `XXX-feature-name.md` naming convention.
    -   **Bonus:** Automatically suggest the next available number prefix (e.g., if `002-something.md` is the last one, suggest `003-`).

-   [ ] **Implement File Creation Logic:**
    -   On form submission, validate the user-provided filename (e.g., ensure it ends with `.md`).
    -   Make a `POST /api/specs/{filename}` request. The body of the request should be an empty string to create an empty file.
    -   After a successful API call:
        -   Refresh the list of specs in the sidebar to include the new file.
        -   Automatically open the newly created (and empty) spec in the editor view.
