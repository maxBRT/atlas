# Frontend: Implement UI for Main Application Spec

This task is to build the complete user interface for creating, viewing, and editing the `application.md` file. This is a primary feature and should be accessible from the main navigation.

## Sub-tasks:

-   [x] **Create Sidebar Navigation Link:**
    -   Add a clearly labeled link in the sidebar, titled "Application Spec".
    -   This link should navigate the user to the main application spec view.

-   [x] **Implement Spec View Component:**
    -   When the component loads, it should immediately call the `GET /api/application` endpoint.
    -   **Handle "File Not Found" (404):** If the API returns a 404 error, the component should display an empty markdown editor and a "Save" button, effectively prompting the user to create the file by adding content and saving.
    -   **Handle "File Found":** If the API returns content, populate the markdown editor with the fetched data.

-   [x] **Integrate Markdown Editor:**
    -   Use a suitable rich text or markdown editor component.
    -   The editor must be able to accept initial content from the API and allow users to modify it.

-   [x] **Implement Save Functionality:**
    -   Add a "Save" button to the view.
    -   On click, the button should take the current content from the editor and send it to the `POST /api/application` endpoint in the required JSON format.
    -   Provide clear user feedback, such as a "Saved!" confirmation message or temporarily disabling the button to prevent multiple submissions.
