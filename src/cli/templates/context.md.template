# AI Context

This document provides context for the AI developer working on this project. It outlines the planning framework used, which is based on the Atlas application.

## The Atlas Planning Framework

This project uses the Atlas planning framework, which stores all planning and specification data as markdown files with YAML frontmatter within a `.atlas` directory at the root of the project repository.

This approach ensures that the plan is always in sync with the code. It allows both human developers and AI agents to interact with the same, up-to-date planning data.

The core components of the framework are:
- **Application Spec (`application.md`):** A central document that outlines the overall application.
- **Roadmap (`roadmap.md`):** A prioritized implementation order for features.
- **Feature Specifications (`/specs`):** Detailed feature specifications as individual markdown files.
- **Tasks/Tickets (`/tasks`):** Development tasks or tickets as individual markdown files.
- **AI Context (`context.md`):** This file, which is a snapshot of the project's structure and conventions.
